We are planning for a  *Blood Donation Camp* in our college campus next week.

Every day, countless individuals rely on blood transfusions for their survival, be it due to medical emergencies, surgeries, or chronic illnesses. Unfortunately, there is an ongoing shortage of blood supply in our community, posing a significant challenge in meeting the needs of those in critical conditions.

By donating blood, you have the incredible power to give someone a second chance at life. Your generosity can alleviate the suffering of patients and bring hope to their families. It only takes a small amount of your time, but the impact you can make is immeasurable.

To send a invite to the concerned organization we need to know the count of interested people who can donate the blood. For the same kindly fill the form given in below link by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
